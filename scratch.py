    (Always unencrypted, must be second field in message) 
    Message length, in bytes, forward to the CheckSum field. 
    ALWAYS SECOND FIELD IN MESSAGE. (Always unencrypted) 


http://fixwiki.org/fixwiki/BodyLength
    The message length is verified by counting the number of characters in the message 
    following the BodyLength field up to, and including, the delimiter immediately 
    preceeding the CheckSum tag ("10=")

reading and writing bytes from sockets
	remember it is possible to read a msg length
	i want efficent read until '|' 
		BinaryReader and SXXXReader do not have such a func 
			although SXXXReader does have ReadUntilNewLine 
				which shows how to do this
	streams are handy, can test by using a memory stream instead of a network stream
	maybe write my own stream like type, similar to SAEA funcs
		ReadUntilDelim - for reading headers, as header length is unknown
		ReadNBytes - for reading the msg len bytes
		AsyncReadN - for waiting on a new msg, when doing async at the borders

		Write
		AsyncFlush

	#### remember encoding
	#### would this improve redis performance
	#### would fredisnet.org article
	#### put  this on nuget

fsFix article
-------------
    
    advantages
        intellisense, no Set and get functions taking integers
        type safety
            single-case DU
        no separate len fields
		first class components gives correct mapping for optional (or not) components with optional (or not) members
        immutable fields, groups and messages
        consiseness of generated code using ADTs compared to C# classes
        value equality
            if arrays are used instead of lists will there still be value equality?
                could write unit test for this

        fscheck can generate valid fix fields for testing

    using fsFix from C#

    speed? compared to C#, to C++

	is generating DUs for groups, components and fields neccessary?
		NO:     the code to read and write messages will know which group (DU case) or component to read or write
		YES:    this enables fscheck to generate groups for testing
					also requires read and write functions that take the DU
					the DU and DU_read and DU_write could go in the fsTest test project


	martin thompsons better fin messaging stuff: http://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.co.uk/	

	would the 'fixed' help with cache locality

	testing 
		convert fsharp messages back to xml, and diff with original
		CONVERT TYPES BACK TO XML, AND DIFF WITH ORIGINAL

	could fix generation be done with a type provider?

	consider making the type generation a fredis article on its own


	what does it mean for elements to be 'condtionally required' (seen on FIX wiki)?  
		could this be required fields of optional components

	first confirm that the below is required
	have fields and groups appear in the order they do in fixXX.xml

	refactor types, e.g. currently have 
		GroupPC, GroupExp, GroupGen, SubGroup

	finish group factory functions
	
	are any other groups compulsory in the same manner as NoSides
		the NoSides group is compulsory (or else it is either 0, 1 or 2 NoSides groups)

	avoid the need for ClOrdID.ClOrdID etc

	is the length of some fields known? so CrapReadUntilDelim is not needed
		will they always be the same length?
		can this length be known at compile time

    
    how does the quickfix data dictionary relate to my ADT structure

    performance vs C# quickFix
        use Benchmarkdotnet




    probably writing the wrong group definition in msg write functions
        where the group could not be merged, will write to the merged group

    write msg header and tail

    conformant date, datetime and time types


    could the "0" etc below be replaced qwith "0"B? if fldValIn was a byte array and not a string
        let ReadBookingUnit (fldValIn:string) : BookingUnit = 
            match fldValIn with
            |"0" -> BookingUnit.EachPartialExecutionIsABookableUnit
            |"1" -> BookingUnit.AggregatePartialExecutionsOnThisOrderAndBookOneTradePerOrder
            |"2" -> BookingUnit.AggregateExecutionsForThisSymbolSideAndSettlementDate
            | x -> failwith (sprintf "ReadBookingUnit unknown fix tag: %A"  x) 





    change generated write/read file names to fix44.FieldReadWrite etc
        including the fix version means different versions of fix can live side by side


    #NoSides group writing
    #NoSides groups are either "OneSide | BothSides" not 0->many
    #       fix?
    #           special writing for NoSides group
    #           consider non-merged nosides groups
    #           consider a container of 1 or 2 noSides - instead of a list
    #               make invalid states non-representable
    #               this container does not need to be generated
    #           consider one NoSides and another NoSides option         

    is it possible for a group to be required and yet have zero elements
        if not then enforce with typing, i.e. the one var<T> and one list<T>
        

    round-trip fscheck group read-writes
    round-trip fscheck msg read-writes

    consider replacing ReadField impl with one that looks up read functions in a Dictionary, constant time



    consider scott walaschins typesafe DU in debug, raw in release optimisation

    
    support custom fields/msgs
        or could just add them to the xml
    
    add copyright and disclaimer to all files
        DO NOT WANT ANYONE SUING ME BECAUSE THIER FIX APP DID NOT WORK

    put field and msg writing in different functions|source files

    currency code type
        would not use this in the realworld


    

misc thoughts

    do literal tags require allocation each time WriteXXX is called? consider having a tag module


    what form does quickfix take to write and read?
        read:    bytestream -> (bytestream, T)
        write    bytestream -> field -> bytestream


    # let ReadAccount valIn =
    #     let tmp =  valIn
    #     Account.Account tmp

    # let WriteAccount (valIn:Account) : string seq = 
    #     seq{ yield "1"; yield valIn.Value.ToString() }
